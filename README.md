# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems.  
The goal is to improve problem-solving skills, practice algorithms & data structures, and track progress over time.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- Each solution is organized by problem number and title.  
- Solutions are primarily written in **Python** (may include other languages in the future).  
- File naming convention:  
  ```
  <problem-number>-<problem-title>.py
  ```
  Example:  
  ```
  001-two-sum.py
  021-merge-two-sorted-lists.py
  ```

## âœ… Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Sorting & Searching  
- Math & Bit Manipulation  

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Strengthen algorithmic thinking  
- Prepare for technical interviews  
- Contribute clean and well-documented solutions  

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Each solution includes comments explaining the approach and time/space complexity.  
- Some problems may have multiple solutions (e.g., brute force vs optimized).
